<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Introduction to Digital Repeat Photography Methods</h2>
<p>The concept of repeat photography for studying environmental has been
introduced to scientists long time ago (See Stephens et al., 1987).
But in the past decade the idea has gained much popularity for monitoring
environmental change (e.g., Sonnentag et al., 2012).
One of the main applications of digital repeat photography is studying vegetation
phenology for a diverse range of ecosystems and biomes (Richardson et al., 2019).
The methods has also shown great applicability in other fields such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>assessing the seasonality of gross primary production,</p></li>
<li><p>salt marsh restoration,</p></li>
<li><p>monitoring tidal wetlands,</p></li>
<li><p>investigating growth in croplands, and</p></li>
<li><p>evaluating phenological data products derived from satellite remote sensing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Obtaining quantitative data from digital repeat photography images is usually
performed by defining appropriate region of interest, also know as ROI’s,
and for the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) color channels, calculating
pixel value (intensity) statistics across the pixels within each ROI.
ROI boundaries are delineated by mask files which define which pixels
are included and which are excluded from these calculations.</p>
<p>The masks are then used to extract color-based time series from a stack of images.
Following the time-series, statistical metrics are used to obtain
1-day and 3-day summary time series.
From the summary product time series, phenological transition dates
corresponding to the start and the end of green-up and green-down
phenological phases are calculated.
In this chapter we explain this process by starting from general
image processing tools and then to phenocam-based software applications.</p>

<p>When we work with images, all data we work with is generally on the scale of each
individual pixel in the image. Therefore, for large images we will be working with
large matrices that hold the value for each pixel. Keep this in mind before opening
some of the matrices we’ll be creating this tutorial as it can take a while for
them to load.</p>

<p>In <em>hazer</em> we can also extract three basic elements of an RGB image :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Brightness</li>
<li>Darkness</li>
<li>Contrast</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="brightness" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.0.3</span> Brightness</h4>
<p>The brightness matrix comes from the maximum value of the R, G, or B channel. We
can extract and show the brightness matrix using the <code>getBrightness()</code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb141"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb141-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co"># extracting the brightness matrix</span></a>

<p><img src="05-PhenoCam_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here the grayscale is used to show the value of each pixel’s maximum brightness
of the R, G or B color channel.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.0.6</span> Image fogginess &amp; haziness</h4>
<p>Haziness of an image can be estimated using the <code>getHazeFactor()</code> function. This
function is based on the method described in
<a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/detecting-foggy-images-and-estimating-the-haze-degree-factor-jcsb.1000226.pdf">Mao et al. (2014)</a>.
The technique was originally developed to for <em>“detecting foggy images and
estimating the haze degree factor”</em> for a wide range of outdoor conditions.</p>
<p>The function returns a vector of two numeric values:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>haze</strong> as the haze degree and</li>
<li><strong>A0</strong> as the global atmospheric light, as it is explained in the original paper.</li>
</ol>
<p>The PhenoCam standards classify any image with the haze degree greater
than 0.4 as a significantly foggy image.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Extracting Timeseries from Images using the xROI R Package</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll learn how to use an interactive open-source toolkit, the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xROI/index.html" target="_blank">xROI R package</a>
that facilitates the process of time series extraction and improves the quality
of the final data. The xROI package provides a responsive environment for
scientists to interactively:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>delineate regions of interest (ROIs),</li>
<li>handle field of view (FOV) shifts, and</li>
<li>extract and export time series data characterizing color-based metrics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the <em>xROI</em> R package, the user can detect FOV shifts with minimal difficulty.
The software gives user the opportunity to re-adjust mask files or redraw new
ones every time an FOV shift occurs.</p>

<div id="xroi-design" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> xROI Design</h3>
<p>The R language and Shiny package were used as the main development tool for xROI,
while Markdown, HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages were used to improve the
interactivity. While Shiny apps are primarily used for web-based applications to
be used online, the package authors used Shiny for its graphical user interface
capabilities. In other words, both the User Interface (UI) and server modules are run
locally from the same machine and hence no internet connection is required (after
installation). The xROI’s UI element presents a side-panel for data entry and
three main tab-pages, each responsible for a specific task. The server-side
element consists of R and bash scripts. Image processing and geospatial features
were performed using the <code>Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)</code> and the
<code>rgdal</code> and <code>raster</code> R packages.</p>

dataset and perform data wrangling steps on PhenoCam sites’ data and metadata.</p>
<p>This tutorial will show you the basic commands for accessing PhenoCam data
through the PhenoCam API. The <em>phenocampapi</em> R package is developed and maintained by
<a href="https://bnasr.github.io/" target="_blank">Bijan Seyednarollah</a>.
The most recent release is available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/bnasr/phenocamapi" target="_blank">PhenocamAPI</a>).

can be found on how to merge external time-series (e.g. Flux data) with the
PhenoCam time-series.</p>
<p>We begin with several useful skills and tools for extracting PhenoCam data
directly from the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring the PhenoCam metadata</li>
<li>Filtering the dataset by site attributes</li>
<li>Downloading PhenoCam time-series data</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Exploring PhenoCam metadata</h2>
<p>Each PhenoCam site has specific metadata including but not limited to how a site
is set up and where it is located, what vegetation type is visible from the
camera, and its climate regime. Each PhenoCam may have zero to several Regions
of Interest (ROIs) per vegetation type. The <em>phenocamapi</em> package is an
interface to interact with the PhenoCam server to extract those data and
process them in an R environment.</p>

<p>Now we have a better idea of the types of metadata that are available for the
Phenocams.</p>
<div id="remove-null-values" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.9.1</span> Remove null values</h3>
<p>We may want to explore some of the patterns in the metadata before we jump into
specific locations.</p>
<p>Let’s look at Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual
Temperature (MAT) across the different field site and classify those by the
primary vegetation type (<code>primary_veg_type</code>) for each site. We can find out what
the abbreviations for the vegetation types mean from the following table:</p>

<p>We now have a variety of data related to this ROI from the Hardwood Stand at Duke
Forest.</p>
<p>Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) is a measure of “greenness” of an area and is
widely used in Phenocam images as an indicator of the green pigment in vegetation.
Let’s use this measure to look at changes in GCC over time at this site. Looking
back at the available data, we have several options for GCC. <code>gcc90</code> is the 90th
quantile of GCC in the pixels across the ROI (for more details,
<a href="https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/PhenoCam_V1.html" target="_blank"> PhenoCam v1 description</a>).
We’ll use this as it tracks the upper greenness values while not including many
outliners.</p>
<p>Before we can plot <code>gcc-90</code> we do need to fix our dates and convert them from
Factors to Date to correctly plot.</p>

<p>The goal of this section was to show how to download a limited number of midday images from the PhenoCam server. However, more extensive datasets should be downloaded from the <a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/network/download/"> PhenoCam </a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <em>phenocamapi</em> R package is developed and maintained by
<a href="https://bnasr.github.io/">Bijan Seyednarollah</a>.
The most recent release is available from

<p>To familiarize yourself with the phenocam API, let’s explore the structure:
<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/api/">https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/api/</a></p>
<p>Explore the options for filtering, file type and so forth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, based on either direct API access or via the phenocamapi package, generate a dataframe of phenocam sites. Select two phenocam sites from <em>different</em> plant functional types to explore (e.g. one grassland site and one evergreen needleleaf site)</p>

Now we can see the transition date for each year of interest and the annual patterns of Gcc.</p>
<p>However, if you want more control over the parameters used during processing, you can run through the three default processing steps as implemented in download_phenocam() and set parameters manually.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the option to specify your own threshold used in determining transition dates.</p>
<p>What would be a reasonable threshold for peak greenness? Or autumn onset? Look at the ts dataset and phenocamr package and come up with a threshold. Use the same code to plot it here:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.12.4</span> Comparing phenology of the same plant function type (PFT) across climate space</h3>
<p>As Dr. Richardson mentioned in his introduction lecture, the same plant functional types (e.g. grasslands) can have very different phenologogical cycles. Let’s pick two phenocam grassland sites: one from a tropical climate (kamuela), and one from an arid climate (konza) here in Arizona:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb271"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb271-1" data-line-number="1">GrassSites=GrassSites[<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">27</span>,<span class="dv">32</span>),]</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now use the code you’ve generated above to pull in data from those sites:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb272"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb272-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;code here&#39;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;code here&quot;</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb274"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb274-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;code here&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s create a subplot of your grasslands to compare phenology, some hint code below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb275"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb275-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co">#some hint code for subplotting in plot_ly:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb275-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#p &lt;- subplot(p1, p2, nrows=2)</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb275-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#p</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you have a subplot of grassland phenology across 2 climates answer the following questions your markdown:
1. What seasonal patterns do you see?
2. Do you think you set your thresholds correctly for transition dates/phenophases? How might that very as a function of climate?
3. What are the challenges of forecasting or modeling tropical versus arid grasslands?</p>

<div id="digital-repeat-photography-written" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.12.5</span> Digital Repeat Photography Written</h3>
<strong>Question 1:</strong> How might or does the PhenoCam project
intersect with your current research or future career goals? <em>(1 paragraph)</em>
</div>
<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
Use the map on the <a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/network/map/">PhenoCam website</a> to answer the following questions. Consider the research question that you may explore as your final semester project or a current project that you are working on and answer each of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there PhenoCams that are in study regions of interest to you?<br />
</li>
<li>Which PhenoCam sites does your current research or final project ideas
coincide with?<br />
</li>
<li>Are they connected to other networks (e.g. LTAR, NEON, Fluxnet)?<br />
</li>
<li>What is the data record length for the sites you’re interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong>
Consider either your current or future research, or a question you’d like to
address durring this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which types of PhenoCam data may be more useful to address these questions?</li>
<li>What non-PhenoCam data resources could be combined with NEON data to help address your question?</li>
<li>What challenges, if any, could you foresee when beginning to work with these
data?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intro to PhenoCam Culmination Activity</strong></p>
<p>Write up a 1-page summary of a project that you might want to explore using PhenoCam data over the duration of this course. Include the types of PhenoCam (and other data) that you will need to implement this project. Save this summary as you will be refining and adding to your ideas over the course of the semester.</p>
