The [USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN)](www.usanpn.org) collects,
organizes, and shares phenological data and information to aid
decision-making, scientific discovery, and a broader understanding of
phenology from a diversity of perspectives. The USA National Phenology
Network consists of a National Coordinating Office (NCO), thousands of
volunteer observers and many partners, including research scientists,
resource managers, educators, and policy-makers. Anyone who participates
in Nature's Notebook or collaborates with NCO staff to advance the
science of phenology or to inform decisions is part of the USA-NPN.

## Vision & Mission

USA-NPN's vision is to provide data and information on the timing of
seasonal events in plants and animals to ensure the well-being of
humans, ecosystems, and natural resources. To support this and its
mission the USA-NPN collects, organizes, and shares phenological data
and information to aid decision-making, scientific discovery, and a
broader understanding of phenology from a diversity of perspectives.

Phenology datasets that are best suited for supporting scientific
discovery and decision making are those that consist of observations of
multiple life-cycle stages collected at regular intervals at the same
locations over multiple years. The USA-NPN collects, stores, and shares
high-quality observations of plant and animal phenology at a national
scale by engaging observers in Nature's Notebook, a national-scale,
multi-taxon phenology observing program appropriate for both
professional and volunteer participants. Because observations are
entirely voluntary, the sampling design for observations is
opportunistic. The Nature's Notebook program has been adopted widely;
data are collected at over 100 academic institutions, 78 National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites, and by hundreds of
researchers to contribute observations to support scientific discovery.
The program is also used by tens of thousands of individual observers
and members of federal, state, NGO, and private sector organizations as
well as K-12 and higher-ed institutions.

A unique aspect of Nature's Notebook is that monitoring can be
undertaken by individuals as well as by community or
regionally-organized groups referred to as Local Phenology Programs
(LPP). Organizations such as nature centers, arboreta, land
conservancies, and National Wildlife Refuges use Nature's Notebook to
meet a diversity of outcomes, including asking and answering scientific
questions about the impact of environmental change, informing natural
resource management and decision-making, and educating and engaging the
public.

## Types of USA-NPN Data:

```

### Observational

Observational phenology data, consisting of observations made of
phenological status on individual organisms, are collected and submitted
by professional and citizen scientists, primarily through the USA-NPN
plant and animal phenology observing program, [Nature's
Notebook](http://www.naturesnotebook.org/). These data are submitted to
the USA-NPN and serve as the backbone of all USA-NPN observational data
products.

Observation protocols consist of status monitoring, in which observers
visit a site at regular intervals to evaluate the phenological status of
marked individual plants (or patches of plants) and animal species The
protocols are described fully in [Denny et al.
(2014)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-014-0789-5).

In this system, phenological status is reported by yes or no answers to
a series of questions, for example, "Do you see leaves?" or "Do you see
active individuals?". In addition to "Yes" or "No," observers may also
report "?", indicating that they are uncertain of the phenophase status.
Observers are also invited to document the degree to which the
phenophase is expressed on an individual plant, or for animals, at a
site. This intensity or abundance question takes the form of a count or
percentage - for example, "95--100 percent" of a beech tree's canopy is
full with "Leaves," or 12 "Active individual" robins are seen.

USA-NPN observational data and derivative products are described in USA
National Phenology Network Observational Data Documentation [(Rosemartin
et al. 2018)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2018/1060/ofr20181060.pdf). The
three formats in which the USA-NPN observational data are made available
include: *status and intensity data*, *individual phenometrics*, and
*site-level phenometrics*.

### Status & Intensity Data

Status and intensity data consist of presence/absence records for
individual phenophases on individual plants or species of animals at a
site on a single visit. These records also include intensity and
abundance measures. Individual Phenometrics and Site Phenometrics, which
are synthesized sequentially from Status and Intensity data, provide
estimated phenophase onset and end dates. Individual Phenometrics are
derived estimates of phenophase onset and end dates for organisms within
a given period of interest. Site Phenometrics are summary metrics of the
onset and end date of phenophase activity across multiple individuals of
the same species at a site within a given period of interest. Magnitude
Phenometrics provide measures of the extent to which a phenophase is
expressed across multiple individuals or sites, for a given time
interval.

These metrics include several approaches for capturing the shape of
seasonal activity curves. In Nature's Notebook, plants are marked and
tracked through time, while animals are not, resulting in several key
differences between the phenometric data types for plants and for
animals. Individual Phenometrics and Site Phenometrics are nearly
identical for animals, while for plants the former provide data for
individual plants and the latter aggregate data across plants of the
same species at a site. Magnitude Phenometrics provide additional
information on animals, including correcting abundance values by search
time and search area, which is not relevant for plants. As additional
observational phenology data types are created by the USA-NPN, they are
described at www.usanpn.org/data/new_data_products.

### Gridded Raster Data

The USA-NPN offers a growing suite of gridded (raster) maps of
phenological events, patterns, and trends. These products include
historical, real-time, and short-term forecasts and anomalies in the
timing of events such as the [start of the spring
season](https://www.usanpn.org/data/spring_indices), and [growing degree
days](https://www.usanpn.org/data/agdd_maps). These products are
described in the USA National Phenology Network gridded products
documentation [(Crimmins et al.
2017)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2017/1003/ofr20171003.pdf)

![Accumulated Growing Degree Days anomaly in
2018](https://www.usanpn.org/files/npn/maps/USA-NPN-AGDD-32base-Anomaly.gif)

### Pheno-Forecasts

[**USA-NPN Pheno-Forecasts**](https://www.usanpn.org/data/forecasts)
include real-time maps and short-term forecasts of insect pest activity
at management-relevant spatial and temporal resolutions and are based on
accumulated temperature thresholds associated with critical life-cycle
stages of econmically important pests. Pheno Forecasts indicate, for a
specified day, the status of the insect's target life-cycle stage in
real time across the contiguous United States. The maps are available
for 12 insect pest species including the invasive emerald ash borer,
hemlock woolly adelgid, and gypsy moth. These products are described in
"Short-term forecasts of insect phenology inform pest management"
[(Crimmins et al.
2020)](https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article/113/2/139/5727873)

```

> Example of USA-NPN's Hemlock Wolly Adelgid Pheno-Forecast for August,

Pheno-Forecasts are also available for an invasive grasses, such as
buffelgrass. The [buffelgrass
Pheno-Forecast](https://usanpn.org/data/forecasts/Buffelgrass) is based
on known precipitation thresholds for triggering green-up to a level
where management actions are most effective. These maps are updated
daily and predict green-up one to two weeks in the future.

Land Surface Phenology products

The USA-NPN offers [maps derived from MODIS 6 land surface phenology
data](https://www.usanpn.org/data/land_surface_phenology). Satellite
observations can be linked to in-situ observations to help understand
vegetation dynamics across large spatial scales.

The MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product (MLCD) provides global land
surface phenology (LSP) data from 2001-present. MLCD serves a wide
variety of applications and is currently the only source of
operationally produced global LSP data. MLCD data have enabled important
discoveries about the role of climate in driving seasonal vegetation
changes, helped to create improved maps of land cover, and support
ecosystem modeling efforts, among many other important applications.

The LSP Climate Indicators (LSP-CI) dataset is a curated collection of
the most relevant phenological indicators: a measure of spring and
autumn timing and a measure of seasonal productivity. Statistically
robust estimates of long-term normals (median and median absolute
deviation, MAD), significance-screened trends (Theil-Sen slope magnitude
where p\<=0.05), and interannual anomalies (in days as well as multiples
of MAD) have been computed for these three phenological indicators. The
data have been mosaiced across CONUS, reprojected and resampled to a
more familiar spatial reference system that matches complementary
datasets and delivered in the universally accessible GeoTIFF format.

## How to Access USA-NPN Data:

The USA-NPN makes the data they produce available through a number of
different channels and tools. This is partly driven by the format of the
data; GIS data, in many ways, can and should be managed differently than
observational records, which can more easily be managed in a relational
database. However, the need for these different venues is also driven by
end-user need. The different tiers of tools makes the data accessible to
anyone regardless of their level of technical experience. This is true
from the casual observer that would like to use the visualization tool
to see how their contributions to citizen science relate to the broader
world, all the way to the data scientist that needs simple and standard
APIs to integrate USA-NPN data into larger applications and analyses.

### The USA-NPN Landing page

\*[USA-NPN GeoServer API](http://geoserver.usanpn.org/geoserver/)

### Rnpn package

This suite of R functions allows for programmatic access to both gridded
and in-situ NPN data sets in an R environment. Full documentation
available here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnpn/rnpn.pdf>

### Phenology Observation Portal (for observational data)

[This tool](https://www.usanpn.org/data/observational) allows users to
download customized datasets of observational data from the National
Phenology Database, which includes phenology data collected via the
Nature's Notebook phenology program (2009-present for the United
States), and additional integrated datasets, such as historical lilac
and honeysuckle data (1955-present). Filters are available to specify
dates, regions, species and phenophases of interest. This provides
access to all phenometrics, which represents varying degrees of data
aggregation.

### Geospatial Request Builder (for raster data and image files)

[This tool](https://www.usanpn.org/geoserver-request-builder) simplifies
the process of accessing NPN gridded data through standard WMS and WCS
services. WMS services provide the data as basic graphic images, such as
PNGs or TIFFs, whereas WCS services provide the same data in formats
accessible to GIS applications.

### Visualization Tool

[The Visualization Tool](https://data.usanpn.org/vis-tool/#/) provides
an easier way to explore phenology data and maps. The user-friendly
interface is intended to allow for searching for comparing general
trends and quick-and-easy access to map data/products.

## Hands on: Accessing USA-NPN Data via rNPN

### Introduction

The USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) is a USGS funded
organization that collects phenological observation records from
volunteer and professional scientists to better understand the impact of
changes in the environment on the timing of species' life cycles. The
USA-NPN also provides a number of raster-based climatological data sets
and phenological models. These in-situ observation and geospatial,
modeled datasets are available through a number of tools and data
services.

The USA-NPN R library, "rnpn", is primarily a data access service for
USA-NPN data products, serving as a wrapper to the [USA-NPN REST based
web services](). This guide details how to use the library to access and
work with all USA-NPN data types.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library('devtools')
devtools::install_github("usa-npn/rnpn")

```

```{r}
library('rnpn')
```

### Accessing USA-NPN Observational Data

USA-NPN Observational data are collected on the ground by citizen and
professional observers following standardized protocols, using the
Nature's Notebook platform. The data are available 2009 to present, and
come in four formats or data types: Status & Intensity, Individual
Phenometrics, Site Phenometrics and Magnitude Phenometrics. An overview
of the differences is provided in the figure below, and each type is
detailed in the following sections. For a complete description of the
USA-NPN approach and notes for working with each data type see the [Open
File Report on USA-NPN Observational
Data](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2018/1060/ofr20181060.pdf).

In Nature's Notebook, observers register a location, and then at each
location they register any number of individual plants or animal
species. The expectation is that the user then takes regular
observations on each individual/species at a regular interval.
Phenological status is reported by yes or no answers to a series of
questions, for example, "Do you see leaves?" or "Do you see active
individuals?". In contrast to traditional monitoring of annual "first"
events (for example, date of first leaf or first robin), this approach
captures absence data when the phenophase is not occurring and repeat
events. Each observation is comprised of a series of 1, 0 and -1 values,
representing yes/no/uncertain for each possible phenophase for the plant
on that date. To explore data in this native "Status and Intensity"
format, see the vignette by the same name.

A few considerations and functions apply across all USA-NPN
Observational data types.

#### Basic format for for Observational data calls

The basic format for an observational data call in the rnpn library is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
npn_download_[NAME OF DATA TYPE] (
  request_source = [NULL]
  year =  [NULL]
  species_ID = [NULL]
)                  
```

'Request source' should usually be populated with your full name or the
name of the organization you represent. Species_ID is the unique
identifier for all the available plants and animals in the USA-NPN
database. You can create a table of all available species and their ID
numbers:

```{r}
species <- npn_species()
```

Search for a species by common name from the full list:

```{r}
species[species$common_name=="red maple",]
```

There are many parameters which can be set beyond these basic ones,
depending on the data type, and further detailed in the other vignettes
featured in this package.

#### Required Parameters

Note that specifying the year(s) of interest is a required parameter.

There's also another required field, "request_source", which is a
user-provided, self-identifying string. This allows the client to
provide some information about who is accessing the data. Knowing who is
using the data is very helpful for our staff to report the impact of the
USA-NPN to the scientific community. The input provided here is entirely
honor-based.

#### Find stations at which a species has been observed

You can also now look up which stations have a registered plant for a
particular species. In the example below, we use the species ID for red
maple, which we were able to find through the npn_species() function, to
find all stations with that species.

```{r eval=FALSE}
npn_stations_with_spp (3)
```

### Status and Intensity Data

The Status and Intensity data type is the most direct presentation of
the phenology data stored in the NPDb. Each row is comprised of a single
record of the status (1/present/"Yes", 0/absent/"No" or
-1/uncertain/"?") of a single phenophase on an individual plant or
species of animal at a site on a single site visit, as well as the
estimated intensity or abundance e.g., percent canopy fullness or number
of individual robins observed respectively.

Retrieving this kind of data using this package is easy, and heavily
parameterized. It's possible to filter data using a number of including
year, geographic extent and species. In this example we get all records
of bird observations in the New England states from 2018.

```{r eval=FALSE}
npn_download_status_data(
  request_source = 'Your Name Here',
  years = c('2018'),
  states = c("NY","PA","VT","MA"),
  functional_types = 'Bird'
)
```

'states' is an example of an optional parameter that allows you to
filter data based on geographic location. Another example is
'functional_types' which allows you to get all available data for a
group of similar species (e.g., all birds, shrubs or invasive species).
The best place to review **all** available optional filters is the
autogenerated package description.

Another important optional parameter is called 'download_path'. By
default requests for data from the services are returned as a data frame
that gets stored in memory as a variable. In some cases, it makes more
sense to save the data to file for easy and fast retrieval later. The
download_path parameter allows you to specify a file path to redirect
the output from the service, without having to fuss with pesky I/O
operations. Additionally, requests made this way streams the data
returned, so if the dataset you're working with is particularly large,
it's possible to redirect the stream of data to file instead of loading
it all into memory which can be useful if your environment doesn't have
enough RAM to store the entire data set at once.

```{r eval=FALSE}
npn_download_status_data(
  request_source = 'Your Name Here', 
  years = c('2018'), 
  functional_types = 'Bird', 
  additional_fields = 'Site_Name', 
  download_path ='Bird_data_2018_SiteName.csv'
)
```

Using this function to get observational records is the most basic
presentation of the data, and is the most robust for doing analysis, but
there are a number of other products offered through the data service
which provide additional value to data end users, outlined in the next
vignettes.

### Individual Phenometrics

While Status and Intensity data provide a direct and complete look at
the observational data, some analyses rely on more synthesized output.
Individual Phenometrics are derived from phenophase status data and
provide estimates of phenophase onset and end dates based on the first
and last "Yes" status values for organisms within a specified season of
interest. Each row in this data type is comprised of values that are
derived from a string of consecutive "Yes" status reports without an
intervening "No" status report for a single phenophase for an individual
plant or animal species at a site, called a "series". For plants, this
data type provides information on the onset and end of a phenophase on
an individual plant. For animals, it provides information on the onset
and end of the presence of an animal species at a site. As animal
presence at a site is much more likely to be interrupted by absence than
the presence of a phenophase on a plant, Status and Intensity data or
Site Phenometrics may be more appropriate for investigating animal
phenology. However, we provide animal phenology in the same format as
individual plants in this data type to allow users to readily compare
individual plant phenology with animal activity.

Note that more than one series may exist for a given phenophase in an
individual plant or animal species within a single growing season or
year, this might occur in the case of leaf bud break followed by a
killing frost and second round of breaking leaf buds. It could also
occur at group sites where two or more observers are reporting on the
same plant on sequential days but are not in agreement on phenophase
status.

Any call for individual phenometrics requires chronological bounds,
usually a calendar year, as determining onset and end depend on knowing
what the time frame of interest is. If you query the services directly
(without the benefit of this library) it's possible to specify arbitrary
dates, in contrast this library allows you to specify a series of
calendar years as input.

Here's an example of how to query the services for individual
phenometrics data. Note that the overall structure and parameters are
very similar to the call for status data. The biggest difference in this
case is that start and end date parameters are now replaced with a
'years' array, which predictably takes a set of year values with which
to query the service.

```{r}
npn_download_individual_phenometrics(
  request_source='Your Name Here', 
  years=c(2013,2014,2015,2016), 
  species_id=c(210), 
  download_path="saguaro_data_2013_2016.csv"
)
```

In this example, we're able to see individual saguaro phenology for 2013
through 2016. The results returned from the service is a tabular set of
records, giving start and end date by individual saguaro plant. By
default, each record contains information about the location, species,
phenophase, and start and end dates.

Climate data from DayMet can also be acquired with Status & Intensity,
Individual Phenometrics and Site Phenometric data types, by setting the
climate_data parameter to true. In this example, we are getting colored
leaves (phenophase ID is 498) data for birches, using the four birch
species IDs, for 2015:

```{r}
npn_download_individual_phenometrics(
  request_source = 'Your Name Here', 
  years = c('2015'), 
  species_ids = c(97, 98, 99, 430), 
  phenophase_ids = c(498), 
  climate_data = TRUE,
  download_path = 'Betula_data_2015.csv'
)
```

To show what this looks like, we can plot the day of year of the first
observation of colored leaves in birches (genus Betula) against summer
Tmax.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BetulaLeaf <-read.csv(
  'Betula_data_2015.csv', 
  header = TRUE, 
  na=-9999, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
plot(
  first_yes_doy~tmax_summer, 
  data=BetulaLeaf, 
  ylab=c("Day of Year"), 
  xlab=c("Tmax Summer"),
  cex=2, 
  cex.axis=1.5, 
  cex.lab=1.5, 
  pch=21
)
```

### Site Phenometrics

Site Phenometrics, derived from Individual Phenometrics, provide summary
metrics of the onset and end date of phenophase activity for a species
at a site. Observers are directed to create sites that represent uniform
habitat and are no larger than 15 acres. For plants, this metric is
calculated as an average for all individuals of a species at the site.
For animals, where individuals are not tracked, this metric represents
the first and last recorded appearance of the species during the season
of interest. For instance, if you asked for red maple leafing data, and
there was a site with three red maple trees being observed, then the
data would be the average onset date for all three of those red maple
trees at that site.

Here's an example of how to query the services for site phenometrics
data, for cloned lilacs, breaking leaf buds, 2013. The call is very
similar to the call for individual phenometrics data, however, in
addition you can supply the quality control filter for the number of
days between a yes record and preceding no record (also applies to the
last yes and following no), for the observation to be included in the
calculations. Typically this is set to 7, 14 or 30, as when downloading
data using the USA-NPN Phenology Observation Portal. If you do not set
this parameter, it defaults to 30 days. Note that in this example the
results are stored in memory, rather than output as a file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
LilacLeafPoints2013<-npn_download_site_phenometrics(
  request_source = 'Your Name Here', 
  years = c('2013'),
  num_days_quality_filter = '30',
  species_ids = '35',
  phenophase_ids = '373'
)
```

In this example we're able to see the date of the first observation of
breaking leaf buds for cloned lilacs, averaged across individuals within
sites. If any observation did not have a preceding no record within 30
days it was excluded from the calculations.

We can now plot our cloned lilac site phenometric onset data by
latitude.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(
  mean_first_yes_doy~latitude, 
  data=LilacLeafPoints2013, 
  ylab=c("Day of Year"), 
  xlab=c("Latitude"),
  cex=2, 
  cex.axis=1.5, 
  cex.lab=1.5, 
  pch=21, 
  xlim=c(30,55), 
  ylim=c(0,200)
)
```

### Magnitude Phenometrics

Magnitude Phenometrics are a suite of eight metrics derived from Status
and Intensity data. This data type provides information on the extent to
which a phenophase is expressed across multiple individuals or sites,
for a given set of sequential time intervals. The data user may select a
weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or custom time interval to summarize the
metrics. Two metrics are available for both plants and animals, one
metric is available for plants alone and five metrics are available for
animals alone (table 1). Three of the five animal metrics correct animal
abundance values for observer effort in time and space.

Here's an example of how to query for Magnitude Phenometrics, for the
active individuals phenophase for black-capped chickadee data, in 2018.
Requirements are similar to other data types. You must additionally
specify the time interval by which the data should be summarized.
Typically this is weekly, biweekly or monthly, as in the POP and
Visualization Tool. The interval chosen in this example is 7 days.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
npn_download_magnitude_phenometrics(
  request_source = 'Your Name Here', 
  years = '2018',
  period_frequency = "7",
  species_ids = '245', 
  phenophase_ids = '292', 
  download_path = 'MPM_BCC_ActInd_2018.csv'
)
```

In this example we're able to see all of the magnitude phenometric
fields, including proportion_yes_records, and mean_num_animals_in-phase.
See the
[https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2018/1060/ofr20181060.pdf](Open%20File%20Report%20on%20USA-NPN%20Observational%20Data)
for full field descriptions.

From this dataset we can view the Proportion_Yes_Records (of all the
records submitted on this species, what proportion are positive/yes
records) by weekly interval:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BCC_AI<-read.csv(
  'MPM_BCC_ActInd_2018.csv', 
  header = TRUE, 
  na=-9999, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
plot(
  BCC_AI$proportion_yes_record~as.Date(BCC_AI$start_date,"%Y-%m-%d"), 
  ylab=c("Proportion Yes Records"), 
  xlab=c("Date"),
  cex=2, 
  cex.axis=1.5, 
  cex.lab=1.5, 
  pch=21,
  xlim=as.Date(c("2018-01-01", "2018-08-01")),
  ylim=c(0,1)
)
```

### USA-NPN Geospatial Data

USA-NPN provides phenology-relevant climate data in raster format. There
are two main suites of products in this category: Accumulated Growing
Degree Days and Extended Spring Indices. Accumulated Growing Degree Days
and the Extended Spring Indices are both representations of accumulated
temperature. As accumulated winter and spring heat drives many spring
season phenological events in much of the country, these products can be
used to better understand patterns in the current and historical timing
of these events across the landscape. For a complete description of the
USA-NPN approach and notes for working with each data type see the [Open
File Report](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2017/1003/ofr20171003.pdf) on
USA-NPN Gridded Data.

Both suites are available as:

-   Current year value, with a 6-day forecast
-   Current year anomaly, with a 6-day forecast
-   Long-term (30 year) average
-   Historical years
    -   AGDD - 2016-Prior Year
    -   Extended Spring Index - 1880-Prior Year

All of these products can be downloaded using the
npn_download_geospatial call. There is a number of other products and
permutations of the above listed AGDD and Spring Index products, so you
can get a complete list of available layers and additional details about
them including resolution, extent and the abstract/layer description.

```{r}
layers <- npn_get_layer_details()
```

The following sections describe how to parameterize calls for both AGDD
and Spring Index layers. These calls result in raster data sets for the
contiguous United States.

If you are interested in how many GDDs had accumulated when the red
maple in your backyard leafed out, or what day the Spring Index
requirements for leaf out were met for your location, you may wish to
query the layers for these values, based on location and date. There are
two ways to accomplish this, using the npn_get_point_data function which
works for all layers and the npn_get_AGDD_point_data function, which
only works for AGDD layers and provides a more precise result.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
npn_get_agdd_point_data(
 'gdd:agdd_50f', 
 '38', 
 '-90', 
 '2019-02-25'
)
```

This returns a value of 7.64098 GDD, base 50F, for the coordinates 38
north, -90 west on February 25th, 2019.

```{r}
npn_get_point_data(
 'si-x:lilac_bloom_ncep', 
 '30', 
 '-90', 
 '2019-02-25'
)
```

This returns a value for lilac bloom of day 48, for the coordinates 30
north, -90 west, as of February 25th, 2019.

The above mentioned AGDD products use base temperatures of 32F or 50F
and are managed through WCS services. There is also a function to get
dynamic AGDD calculations based on a user defined base temperature and a
number of other parameters.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
custom_agdd_raster <- npn_get_custom_agdd_raster(
 method = 'double-sine',
 climate_data_source = 'NCEP',
 temp_unit = 'fahrenheit',
 start_date = '2019-01-01',
 end_date = '2019-05-10',
 base_temp = 20,
 upper_threshold = 90
)
```

## Accumulated Growing Degree Day Products

Heat accumulation is commonly used as a way of predicting the timing of
phenological transitions in plants and animals, including when plants
exhibit leaf out, flowering, or fruit ripening, or when insects emerge
from dormancy. This is typically expressed as accumulated heat units,
either Growing Degree Hours or Growing Degree Days. Growing degree day
thresholds have been established for many species, and are commonly used
in agriculture, horticulture, and pest management to schedule activities
such as harvesting, pesticide treatment, and flower collection. The
USA-NPN is currently generating Accumulated Growing Degree Days (AGDD)
rasters using a January 1 start date, calculated using simple averaging.
These are available calculated using two base temperatures, 32 degrees
Fahrenheit (F) and 50 F.

When querying certain layers, the underlying data is agnostic about the
specific year, and in these cases it makes sense to use the day of year
to request data, since that will provide a standardized result, (i.e.,
April 1st is day 91 in some years and day 92 in others).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
npn_download_geospatial(
 'gdd:30yr_avg_agdd_50f', 
 95
)
```

But if you're looking at a specific year, such as a current year layer,
it makes sense to use a specific calendar date (formatted YYYY-MM-DD).
It's also possible to save the raster directly to file instead of
loading it into memory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
npn_download_geospatial(
 'gdd:agdd', 
 '2018-05-05',
 output_path='20180505-agdd-value.tiff'
)
```

In the case of the historic Spring Index layers, however, the product
represents the overall outcome for the entire year, so while the year
component of the date matters, the month and day do not. In this case,
specify January 1 as the month and date.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
npn_download_geospatial(
 "si-x:average_bloom_prism",
 "1995-01-01"
)
```

The dimension.range value, returned in the npn_get_layer_details()
function, clarifies the full set of applicable dates for each layer.

Of course, it's also easy to grab raster data and load it into a visual
plot as in this example, showing a map of AGDD base 50 on 2019-06-25:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
AGDDJun2019<-npn_download_geospatial(
 'gdd:agdd_50f', 
 '2019-06-25'
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(
 AGDDJun2019, 
 main = "AGDD base 50 on June 25th, 2019"
)
```

An important layer to know of is the 30 year average for AGDD products.
This is useful for many comparative analyses. This layer takes DOY as
the date input, since it's the average AGDD value for each day of year
for 1981 - 2010.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
average_30yr <- npn_download_geospatial(
 "gdd:30yr_avg_agdd",
 45
)
```

## Extended Spring Indices

The Extended Spring Indices are mathematical models that predict the
"start of spring" (timing of first leaf or first bloom) at a particular
location. These models were constructed using historical observations of
the timing of first leaf and first bloom in a cloned lilac cultivar
(Syringa X chinensis 'Red Rothomagensis') and two cloned honeysuckle
cultivars (Lonicera tatarica L. 'Arnold Red' and Lonicera korolkowii
Stapf, also known as 'Zabelii'), which were selected based on the
availability of historical observations from across a wide geographic
area. Primary inputs to the model are temperature and weather events,
beginning January 1 of each year. The model outputs are first leaf and
first bloom date for a given location.

Data for the Spring Index is available through an enumeration of layers
that represents each of the three sub-models as well as an 'average'
model which represents the aggregation of the three sub-models. These
layers are further enumerated by both of the represented phenophases,
leaf and bloom. In the example below, first the layer representing only
the Arnold Red model for 1987 is retrieved, while the second function
call gets the model averaging all three of the models for the same year.

```{r eval=FALSE}
npn_download_geospatial(
 "si-x:arnoldred_bloom_prism",
 "1987-01-01"
)
average_model <- npn_download_geospatial(
 "si-x:average_bloom_prism",
 "1987-01-01"
)
```

The Spring Indices are also unique in that the algorithm has been run
against the BEST climate data set, so historic data going back to 1880
is available.

```{r, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
BESTSIxData1905 <- npn_download_geospatial(
 'si-x:average_bloom_best', 
 '1905-01-01'
)
NAvalue(BESTSIxData1905) <- -9999
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(
 BESTSIxData1905, 
 main = "Spring Index, 1905"
)
```

### Other Layers

Besides the AGDD and Spring Index layers there are a number of other
useful layers available through these services, including daily
temperature minimum and maximums and aggregated MODISv6 phenometrics.

The daily temperature minimum and maximum values are the underlying
climate data used to generate current year AGDD and Spring Index maps.
These data are generated by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP) and are reserved through NPN's geospatial services.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
daily_max_20190505 <- npn_download_geospatial(
 'climate:tmax', 
 '2019-05-05'
)
plot(
 daily_max_20190505, 
 main = "Daily Temperature Max (C), May 5th, 2019"
)
```

The MODISv6 layers are aggregate values for remote sensing values from
the MODISv6 data set, representing a subset of the following
phenometrics, aggregated across 2001 - 2017: EVI Area, Mid-Greenup,
Mid-Greendown. The available aggregate values for each layer are:
median, TSslope, and mean absolute deviation. This example shows the
median green up value, as DOY. Note that because this layer has a fixed
date, the date parameter is input as a blank string.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
median_greenup <- npn_download_geospatial(
 'inca:midgup_median_nad83_02deg',
 ''
)
plot(
 median_greenup, 
 main = "MODIS Median Mid-Greenup, 2001 - 2017"
)
```

## Putting it all together:

## Combine Point and Raster Data

Observational and gridded data can be visualized or analyzed together
for a variety of purposes. Users may want to identify spatial patterns
in the alignment of dogwood bloom and the Spring Index bloom model. The
current year's lilac leaf out observations may be compared to the 30
year average lilac sub-model of the spring index to see how well the
model predicts the observations.

This example shows several data access calls to assemble observational
and gridded data.

Option 1: You can add a parameter to an observational data call to
additionally get a gridded layer value for each observation
location/date. Note that if you don't specify which sub model of the
Spring Index you want, you will get the SI-x Average layers.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
npn_download_site_phenometrics(
  request_source = 'Your Name Here', 
  years = '2013',
  num_days_quality_filter = '30', 
  species_ids = '35',
  phenophase_ids = '373', 
  download_path = 'cl_lilac_data_2013_SIxLeaf.csv',
  six_leaf_layer = TRUE,
  six_sub_model = 'lilac'
)
```

If you want to append raster data other than Spring Index, Leaf values,
there's alternative boolean flags that can be set, including
six_bloom_layer for Spring Index, Bloom data, and agdd_layer. Instead of
TRUE or FALSE agdd_layer takes 32 or 50 and will correlate each data
point with the corresponding AGDD value for the given date using either
32 or 50 base temperature.

Option 2: You can create a combined plot of observational data with
modeled/raster data.

Building on the approach for accessing point data from earlier vignettes
describing Individual Phenometrics and getting raster data, we can
access and plot these products together. In this example, we will look
at how well cloned lilac leaf out observations in 2018 are predicted by
the lilac leaf sub model of the Spring Index.

### Step 1: Get the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
LilacLeaf2018<-npn_download_geospatial(
  'si-x:lilac_leaf_ncep', 
  '2018-12-31', 
)
LilacLeaf2018Obs <-npn_download_individual_phenometrics(
  request_source = 'Your Name Here', 
  years = '2018',
  species_ids = '35',
  phenophase_ids = '373' 
)
```

### Step 2: Preparing the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
coords <- LilacLeaf2018Obs[ , c("longitude", "latitude")]
data <- as.data.frame(LilacLeaf2018Obs$first_yes_doy)
crs <- CRS("+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 
                 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")
LL_spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(
  coords = coords,
  data = data, 
  proj4string = crs
)
```

### Step 3: Define style options and create graph

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my.palette <- brewer.pal(n=9,name="OrRd")
plot(
  LilacLeaf2018, 
  col = my.palette,
  main="2018 Observed and Predicted Lilac Leaf Out"
)
plot(
  LL_spdf,
  main="Lilac Obs",
  pch = 21,
  bg = my.palette,
  col = 'black',
  xlim=c(-125.0208,-66.47917),
  ylim=c(24.0625 ,49.9375),
  add = TRUE
)
legend(
  "bottomright", 
  legend=c("Cloned Lilac Leaf Out Observations"),
  pch = 21,
  bg = 'white',
  col = 'black',
  bty="n", 
  cex=.8
)
```

## USA-NPN Coding Lab

```{r, quiet=TRUE, warnings=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(rnpn)
library(ggplot2)
library(neonUtilities)
library(dplyr)
source('/Users/rohan/katharynduffy.github.io/neon_token_source.R')

```

1.  For the purposes of this exercise we will be focusing on two NEON
    sites: `HARV` and `CPER`. Save these two sites into your workplace
    so that you can feed them into functions and packages.

2.  Define AGDD and write the equation using LaTeX. What is an
    appropriate time interval over which we should calculate AGDD? *This
    will be relevant for following questions*

3.  Use the `neonUtilities` package to pull plant phenology observations
    (DP1.10055.001). We will work with the `statusintensity` data:

Hints:

```{r, quiet=TRUE, results=FALSE}
#TOS Phenology Data
sitesOfInterest <- c("HARV")

dpid <- as.character('DP1.10055.001') #phe data
 
pheDat <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.10055.001",
                     site = sitesOfInterest,
                     package = "basic",
                     check.size = FALSE, 
                     token=NEON_TOKEN)

#NEON sends the data as a nested list, so I need to undo that
# unlist all data frames
list2env(pheDat ,.GlobalEnv)
summary(phe_perindividualperyear)
summary(phe_statusintensity)

#remove duplicate records
phe_statusintensity <- select(phe_statusintensity, -uid)
phe_statusintensity <- distinct(phe_statusintensity)
```

```{r}
library(lubridate)
#Format dates
phe_statusintensity$date <- as.Date(phe_statusintensity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
phe_statusintensity$editedDate <- as.Date(phe_statusintensity$editedDate, "%Y-%m-%d")
phe_statusintensity$year <- as.numeric(substr(phe_statusintensity$date, 1, 4))
phe_statusintensity$month <- as.numeric(format(phe_statusintensity$date, format="%m"))
```

In your `phe_statusintensity` data.frame pick a phenophase name of
interest:

```{r}
unique(phe_statusintensity$phenophaseName)
```

And select a single taxon:

```{r}
unique(phe_perindividual$taxonID)
```

Now create a new, filtered `dataframe` only including those observations
and print a summary. You'll also want to filter for typical things like
`NA` values, and think about how you'll work with data that comes in
factors or strings. Are there ways you could extract numerical values
for plotting? Could you `count` data? Summarize your strategy.

4.  Using dpid **DP1.00002.001** Single Aspirated Air Temperature
    calculate AGDD based on NEON tower data over the time period you
    decidided upon in question 1. To save you time and frustration I've
    placed some **mostly complete** example code for *one* height on the
    tower *just for Harvard*. **You will need to determine which height
    you think it best and conmplete these calculations for both sites.**
    You will also need to consder things like filtering your temperature
    data for quality flags, and converting from GMT (Greenwich Mean
    Time) to [your location's
    time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395117/how-do-you-convert-dates-times-from-one-time-zone-to-another-in-r):

```{r libraries, eval=FALSE}

##load libraries
#library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
#install.packages('mgcv')
library(mgcv)

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

dpid <- as.character('DP1.00002.001')  ##single aspirated air temperature

tempDat <- loadByProduct(dpID=dpid,
                        site = "HARV", 
                        startdate = "2017-01",
                        enddate="2017-12",
                        avg=30,
                        package = "basic",
                        check.size = FALSE)

df <- tempDat$SAAT_30min

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# GDD typically reported in F
# convert df temps
df$meanTempF=df$tempSingleMean*1.8+32

#pull date value from dateTime
df$date <- substr(df$endDateTime, 1, 10)
```

**Group data and summarize values**

Here, I will group the 30-minute temperature averages by data (to get
daily values)

**You will want to consider which vertical position is most appropriate
to use for your analysis.**

You can view the sensor position data in the sensor_positions table
downloaded above, where HOR.VER are the horizontal and vertical position
indices (separated by a period),and zOffset is in meters above the
ground:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  select(tempDat$sensor_positions_00002, c(HOR.VER, zOffset))
```

you can also view all of the sensor position info with the following
line:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(tempDat$sensor_positions_00002)
```

For example, the lowest position sensor (verticalPosition == 010) may be
most appropriate for comparison with the phenological state of very
short plants, while the highest verticalPosition may be better for
comparison with canopy trees.

Here I'll select level 1 for demonstration

```{r, eval=FALSE}
day_temp <- df%>%
  filter(verticalPosition=="010")%>%
  group_by(siteID, date)%>%
  mutate(dayMaxTemp=max(meanTempF), dayMinTemp=min(meanTempF),
         dayMeanTemp=mean(meanTempF))%>%
  select(siteID, date, dayMaxTemp, dayMinTemp, dayMeanTemp)%>%
  distinct()

##alternative, simplified mean, consistent with many GDD calculations 
### does accumulation differ for true mean vs. simplified mean?
day_temp$mean2 <- (day_temp$dayMinTemp + day_temp$dayMaxTemp)/2
```

**Caluculate daily GDD for a true mean**

*50 degrees F is a common base temperature used to calculate plant
specific GDD. When might you select a different base temp?*

*How might you want to deal with different 'means' of temperature? A
couple of options below:*

```{r, eval=FALSE}
day_temp$GDD1 <- ifelse(day_temp$dayMeanTemp-50 < 0, 0, round(day_temp$dayMeanTemp-50, 0))
day_temp$GDD2 <- ifelse(day_temp$mean2-50 < 0, 0, round(day_temp$mean2-50, 0))
day_temp$GDD3 <- ifelse(day_temp$dayMeanTemp-50 < 0, 0, round(day_temp$mean2-50, 0))

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

5.  Plot your calculated AGDD and comment on your calculations. Do you
    need to revise your time horizon or sensor height?

6.  Now we're going to build a model to see how AGDD impacts
    phenological status. But Wait. Is phenology **all** driven by
    temperature? Should you consider any other variables? What about
    AGDD **and** just plain temperature? Also, we have one very
    temperate site, and another that is a semi-arid grassland. Should
    water availability of any sort be considered? Any other variables or
    data?

Create a [GAM (Generalized Additive
Model)](https://dereksonderegger.github.io/578/7-beyond-linearity.html#gams)
for your phenological data including any variables you think might be
relevant.

One of the bonuses of a GAM is that it will tell you which variables are
relevant and which aren't so you can iterate a bit on your model and
revise it. You might want to test a few positions on your asipirated air
temperature, or a few other additional variables. Your selection is up
to you, but you must document and justify your decision.

Hints:

    library(mgcv)
    model <- mgcv::gam(phenological_status_you_picked ~ AGDD + s(temp or maybe precip) + s(doy), data=your_data)
    mgcv::summary.gam(model) 

and plot your models for each site: Hint:

    mgcv::plot.gam(model, pages=1 )

7.  Now that we have a model for NEON data, let's use the rnpn package
    to see how adding additional data could improve our fit. Use the
    `taxonID` that you selected at each NEON tower, and feed that to the
    `rnpn` package to grab observational data and increase your number
    of observations.

Hints:

-   Feeding a state or other region will make the data more congruent
-   You'll likely need to either request the phenophase that you
    selected from NEON, or filter again.
-   It might make your life easier to request the NEON data from `rnpn`
    as they host it as well.

8.  Pull AGDD from USA-NPN based on the observations you just pulled.

9.  Combine your NEON and USA-NPN data into the same data.frame and
    re-fit your GAM.

-   Summarize your new model
-   Plot your new model
-   Comment on your new model: was it improved? If so how?

## Understanding Observation Biases and Censoring in Citizen Science Data

> The following information was adapted from Zachmann et al. (in prep)
> and is not to be distributed or used beyond this course.

One significant barrier to advancing our understanding and utilization
of phenology information is wrapped up in the ability of existing models
to represent drivers of phenology and phenological shifts appropriately.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./docs/images/700phenology.jpg')
```

The specific timing of phenological events, such as first leaf or first
flower in plants, is affected by multiple, potentially interacting
climatic and geophysical factors. For example, soil moisture supply,
atmospheric demand for water, frost events, day length, and terrain have
all been shown to influence species' phenology. **Many of these factors
vary over time as well as space.** Additionally, some of their *effects
may themselves* vary over time as a result of interactions among
controls on phenology.

**For instance:**

-   Precipitation and temperature likely interact to initiate
    phenological events;

-   Precipitation triggers a state change only after enough heat has
    accumulated at a given site over the course of the growing season.

Phenological predictions, specifically, consist of estimates of the
anticipated onset dates of key events: *bud break and the arrival of
spring, for example, or plant senescence in the fall*.

In order to track anomalies in real-time, we need forecasts of
phenology. Further, we need forecasts of long-term shifts in phenology
as a result of climate change. However, making any such predictions
requires both **reasonable** *and* **skillful** models of phenology.

> By "reasonable" we refer to models that are appropriate for the data
> -- including any "nonignorable" aspects of the sampling design, Gelman
> et al. (2013) -- and the underlying ecological process, while by
> "skillful" we mean that the model has adequate predictive performance.

### Many existing modeling approaches fail in one (or both) regards.

Much of the existing work relies on models that implicitly or explicitly
ignore key characteristics of phenological data and the ecological
process of phenology. For example, many studies ignore censoring and
other aspects of the sampling design underlying observations, including
the location and nestedness of sampling units, or incompletely account
for the dynamic nature of phenological drivers. Efforts that fail to
account for these features of the data are liable to misrepresent the
ecological process, thereby making predictions that are demonstrably
wrong and potentially biased. Though it can be argued that some
information is better than no information, scientific understanding and
consequential management actions require the right information. In other
words, **it is better to be ignorant than misled.**

### Censoring

Time-to-event data are rarely recorded accurately, in which case
observations are said to be censored. There are several types of
censoring we must consider. In the context of plant phenology, perhaps
the most common is **interval censoring**, which occurs when a
**phenological event transpires between visits to a site**.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./docs/images/cens1.png')
```

Taking first leaf as an example, a deciduous shrub at site i might be
completely leafless at the time of the first visit, li, but could have
several emerging leaves at time of the second visit ri. The size of the
interval depends on how frequently the site is visited, and may span
days or weeks. All that is known is that the event of interest happened
in (li,ri), rather than an exact time.

Censoring is often ignored in analysis, or it is addressed, potentially
inappropriately, using imputation techniques. When the intervals are
small relative to the full timespan of interest, the bias introduced by
interval censored observations may be small enough to be safely ignored.
Either such assumptions must be tested or statistical methods that
account for this feature of the sampling design must be used.

## So then how can we model censored data?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./docs/images/cens2.png')
```

> in prep)

For logistical or other reasons, record-keeping at some sites starts
earlier than others. Additionally, some of the observers make visits to
sites more frequently than others. Analyses that do not account for this
sampling process explicitly are somewhat impaired --- they must filter
the observations for known events (times represented by visits shown in
purple) and must discard others (e.g., the data for sites 30 and 77), or
must impute times using single-point imputation techniques, which have
been shown to lead to invalid inference.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./docs/images/cens3.png')
```

Here the authors seek to model the latent distribution of event times
(the green line overlaying the histogram in the upper panel) that gives
rise to the observations seen in the lower panel. As they begin to
introduce both greater complexity, realism, and utility, they can model
the moments (or parameters) of the latent distribution using
well-established deterministic models involving climatic and other
phenological forcings.

## Intro to USA-NPN Culmination Activity

**Note: Phenology data may not be relevant everyone. Here are a couple of suggestions:**


1.  Be creative, example: Say you work with ground water hydrology, how
    could leaves on trees perhaps be relevant to groundwater recharge
    rate? Might there be a lag? Etc etc.

2.  I will fully accept alternate citizen-science-based datasets and
    project proposals based on those. The challenge of taking this
    option is that we have not covered that data.

Write up a 1-page **derived data product or research pipeline proposal**
summary of a project that you might want to explore using USA-NPN data.
Include the types of USA-NPN (and other data) that you will need to
implement this project. Save this summary as you will be refining and
adding to your ideas over the course of the semester.

Sugestions:

1.  Tables or bullet lists of **specific** data products

2.  An **overarching high-quality figure** to show how these data align

3.  One paragaph summarizing *how* this data or analysis is useful to
    **you and/or the infrastructure**.
