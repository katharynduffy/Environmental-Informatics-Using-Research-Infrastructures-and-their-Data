Hi, I'm Dr. Katharyn Duffy.  I have a Ph.D in Earth Science from Northern Arizona University.  Over the past two years I've worked as an open-source software engineer in the PhenoCam lab, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course.  I really look forward to working with all of you!

Hello! I'm Emma Reich. I have a BS in Molecular Environmental Biology from UC Berkeley and a background in plant ecophysiology and stable isotope analysis. I also used to work as a field tech for NEON. I'm a first year PhD student in the T3 program in Kiona Ogle's lab and I'm interested in evapotranspiration partitioning and Bayesian analysis.
