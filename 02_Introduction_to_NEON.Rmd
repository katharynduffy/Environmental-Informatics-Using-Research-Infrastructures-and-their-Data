# Introduction to NEON & its Data


>Estimated Time: 2 hours


**Course participants**: As you review this information, please
consider the final course project
that you will work on the over this semester. At the end of this section you will document an initial research question, or idea and associated data needed to
address that question, that you may want to explore while pursuing this course.




## Learning Objectives

At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain the mission of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
* Explain the how sites are located within the NEON project design.
* Determine how the different types of data that are collected and provided by NEON, and how they align with your own research.
* Pull NEON data from the API and `neonUtilities` package [@R-neonUtilites]

 


## The NEON Project Mission & Design

To capture ecological heterogeneity across the United States, [NEONâ€™s design](https://www.neonscience.org/neon-project-science-brochure)
divides the continent into 20 statistically different eco-climatic domains. Each
NEON field site is located within an eco-climatic domain.

## Accessing NEON Data

NEON data are processed and go through quality assurance quality control checks
at NEON headquarters in Boulder, CO.
NEON carefully documents every aspect of sampling design, data collection,
processing and delivery. This documentation is freely available through the
NEON data portal.

* Visit the
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/home" target="_blank">NEON Data Portal - data.neonscience.org </a>
* Read more about the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data/data-processing" target="_blank">quality assurance and quality control processes for NEON data</a>
and how the data are processed from raw data to higher level data products.
* <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore" target="_blank">Explore NEON Data Products</a>.
On the page for each data product in the catalog you can find the basic information
about the product, find the data collection and processing protocols, and link
directly to downloading the data.
* Additionally, some types of NEON data are also available through the data portals
of other organizations. For example,
<a href="http://www.ibol.org/dna-barcodes-for-neons-terrestrial-insects/" target="_blank"> NEON Terrestrial Insect DNA Barcoding Data</a>
is available through the
<a href="http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/databases" target="_blank"> Barcode of Life Datasystem (BOLD)</a>.
Or NEON phenocam images are available from the
<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/network/search/?sitename=neon&type=&primary_vegtype=&dominant_species=&active=1&fluxdata=1" target="_blank">Phenocam network site</a>.
More details on where else the data are available from can be found in the Availability and Download
section on the Product Details page for each data product (visit
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore" target="_blank">Explore Data Products</a>
to access individual Product Details pages).

### Pathways to access NEON Data
There are several ways to access data from NEON:

1. Via the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/home" target="_blank">NEON data portal</a>.
Explore and download data. Note that much of the tabular data is available in zipped
.csv files for each month and site of interest. To combine these files, use the
neonUtilities package (<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neonDataStackR" target="_blank">R tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-utilities-python" target="_blank">Python tutorial</a>).  
2. Use R or Python to programmatically access the data. NEON and community members
have created code packages to directly access the data through an API. Learn more
about the available resources by reading the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data/code-resources" target="_blank">Code Resources page</a> or visiting the
<a href="https://github.com/NEONScience" target="_blank">NEONScience GitHub repo</a>.  
3. Using the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-api" target="_blank">NEON API</a>. Access NEON data directly
using a custom API call.
4. Access NEON data through partner's portals. Where NEON data directly overlap
with other community resources, NEON data can be accessed through the portals.
Examples include Phenocam, BOLD, Ameriflux, and others. You can learn more in the
documentation for individual data products.  

## Hands on: Accessing NEON Data & User Tokens

### Via the NEON API, with your User Token

NEON data can be downloaded from either the NEON Data Portal or the NEON API. 
When downloading from the Data Portal, you can create a user account. Read 
about the benefits of an account on the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data/about-data/data-portal-user-accounts" target="_blank">User Account page</a>. You can also use your account to create a token for using the 
API. Your token is unique to your account, so don't share it.

While using a token is optional in general, it is required for this course. Using a token when downloading data via the API, 
including when using the neonUtilities package, links your downloads to 
your user account, as well as enabling faster download speeds. For more 
information about token usage and benefits, see the 
<a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-api" target="_blank">NEON API documentation</a> page.

For now, in addition to faster downloads, using a token helps NEON to track 
data downloads. Using **anonymized** user information, they can then calculate 
data access statistics, such as which data products are downloaded most 
frequently, which data products are downloaded in groups by the same users, 
and how many users in total are downloading data. This information helps NEON 
to evaluate the growth and reach of the observatory, and to advocate for 
training activities, workshops, and software development.

Tokens can (and should) be used whenever you use the NEON API. In this tutorial, we'll 
focus on using tokens with the neonUtilities R package.

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

### Objectives
After completing this section, you will be able to:

 * Create a NEON API token 
 * Use your token when downloading data with neonUtilities 
 


### Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need a version of R (3.4.1 or higher) and `RStudio` 
loaded on your computer.

### Install R Packages

1. **neonUtilities:** `install.packages("neonUtilities")`

## Additional Resources

2. NEON <a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> Data Portal </a>
3.  <a href="https://github.com/NEONScience" target="_blank">NEONScience GitHub Organization</a>
4. <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neonDataStackR" target="_blank">neonUtilities tutorial</a>

</div>

If you've never downloaded NEON data using the neonUtilities package before, 
we recommend starting with the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/download-explore-neon-data" target="_blank">Download and Explore tutorial</a> before proceeding with this tutorial.

In the next sections, we'll get an API token from the NEON Data Portal, and 
then use it in neonUtilities when downloading data.

### Get a NEON API Token 

The first step is create a NEON user account, if you don't have one. 
Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data/about-data/data-portal-user-accounts" target="_blank">Data Portal User Accounts</a> page. If you do already 
have an account, go to <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/home" target="_blank">the NEON Data Portal</a>, 
sign in, and go to your My Account profile page.

Once you have an account, you can create an API token for yourself. At 
the bottom of the My Account page, you should see this bar: 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/get-api-token-button.png')
```

Click the 'GET API TOKEN' button. After a moment, you should see this:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/account-page-token-view.png')
```

Click on the Copy button to copy your API token to the clipboard.


### Use the API token in neonUtilities 

In the next section, we'll walk through saving your token somewhere secure but 
accessible to your code. But first let's try out using the token the easy way.

First, we need to load the `neonUtilities` package and set the working 
directory:

```{r loadStuff, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
# install neonUtilities - can skip if already installed, but
# API tokens are only enabled in neonUtilities v1.3.4 and higher
# if your version number is lower, re-install
install.packages("neonUtilities")
# load neonUtilities
library(neonUtilities)
# set working directory
wd <- "~/data" # this will depend on your local machine
setwd(wd)
```

NEON API tokens are very long, so it would be annoying to keep pasting the 
entire text string into functions. Assign your token an object name:

```{r nameToken, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
NEON_TOKEN <- "PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE"
```

Now we'll use the `loadByProduct()` function to download data. Your 
API token is entered as the optional `token` input parameter. For 
this example, we'll download Plant foliar traits (DP1.10026.001).

```{r getCFC, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
foliar <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.10026.001", site="all", 
                        package="expanded", check.size=F,
                        token=NEON_TOKEN)
```

You should now have data saved in the `foliar` object; the API 
silently used your token. If you've downloaded data without a 
token before, you may notice this is faster!

This format applies to all `neonUtilities` functions that involve 
downloading data or otherwise accessing the API; you can use the 
`token` input with all of them. For example, when downloading 
remote sensing data:

```{r getAOP, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
chm <- byTileAOP(dpID="DP3.30015.001", site="WREF", 
                 year=2017, check.size=F,
                 easting=c(571000,578000), 
                 northing=c(5079000,5080000), 
                 savepath=wd,
                 token=NEON_TOKEN)
```

### Token management for open code

Your API token is unique to your account, so don't share it!

If you're writing code that will be shared with colleagues or available 
publicly, such as in a GitHub repository or supplemental materials of a 
published paper, you can't include the line of code above where we assigned 
your token to `NEON_TOKEN`, since your token is fully visible in the code 
there. Instead, you'll need to save your token locally on your computer, 
and pull it into your code without displaying it. There are a few ways to 
do this, we'll show two options here.

* Option 1: Save the token in a local file, and `source()` that file at the 
start of every script. This is fairly simple but requires a line of code in 
every script.

* Option 2: Add the token to a `.Renviron` file to create an environment 
variable that gets loaded when you open R. This is a little harder to set 
up initially, but once it's done, it's done globally, and it will work in 
every script you run.

#### OPtion 1: Save token in a local file

Open a new, empty R script (.R). Put a single line of code in the script:

```{r scriptToSource, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
NEON_TOKEN <- "PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE"
```

Save this file within your current R project and call the file `neon_token_source.R`.  So that you don't accidently push your token up to GitHub, move over to the command line or Atom.io and add it to your `.gitignore` file: 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('./docs/images/git_ignore.png')
```

Now, whenever you want to pull NEON data via the API, at the start of any analysis you would place this line 
of code:

```{r source, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
source('neon_token_source.R')
```

Then you'll be able to use `token=NEON_TOKEN` when you run `neonUtilities` 
functions, and you can share your code without accidentally sharing your 
token.

#### Option 2: Save your toekn to your R environment

Instructions for finding and editing your .Renviron can be found in this tutorial in [NEON's Data Tutorials section.](https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-tokens-tutorial)

## Hands on: NEON TOS Data

### Pull in Tree Data from NEON's TOS and investigate relationships

> Adapted from [Claire Lunch's 'Compare tree height measured from the ground to a Lidar-based Canopy Height Model'](https://www.neonscience.org/tree-heights-veg-structure-chm) tutorial 


Later in this course we will be working with NEON's LiDAR-based Canopy Height Model (CHM) data from their extensive Airborne Observation Platform (AOP).  In this section we will pull in **DP1.10098.001, Woody plant vegetation structure** from NEON's Terrestrial Observation Sampling (TOS) data and explore the data, from requesting it to plotting it.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./docs/images/NEON_TOS_Sampling.png')
```

> Generalized TOS sampling schematic, showing the placement of Distributed, Tower, and Gradient Plots from the [NEON GUIDE TO WOODY PLANT VEGETATION STRUCTURE, 2018](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.neonscience.org%2Fapi%2Fv0%2Fdocuments%2FNEON_vegStructure_userGuide_vA&psig=AOvVaw32PujoEegMkzIWVuL_Scwn&ust=1597765301177000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCOjFiN_JousCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAU)

The [vegetation structure data](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10098.001) are collected by by field staff on the ground. This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from in-situ measurements of live and standing dead woody individuals and shrub groups, from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. The exact measurements collected per individual depend on growth form, and these measurements are focused on enabling biomass and productivity estimation, estimation of shrub volume and biomass, and calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne remote-sensing data products. In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged and measured, and other smaller individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Smaller individuals may be subsampled according to a nested subplot approach in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort. Structure and mapping data are reported per individual per plot; sampling metadata, such as per growth form sampling area, are reported per plot. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./docs/images/NEON_woody_sampling.png')
```

Locations of subplots are denoted with plain text numbers, and locations of nested subplots are denoted with italic numbers from the [NEON GUIDE TO WOODY PLANT VEGETATION STRUCTURE, 2018](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.neonscience.org%2Fapi%2Fv0%2Fdocuments%2FNEON_vegStructure_userGuide_vA&psig=AOvVaw32PujoEegMkzIWVuL_Scwn&ust=1597765301177000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCOjFiN_JousCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAU)

For the purpose of this hands-on activity we will be using data from the Wind River Experimental Forest NEON field site located in Washington state.  The predominant vegetation at that site is tall evergreen conifers.

*Note: this is also a core site for many other networks such as [AmeriFlux and FLUXNET](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-Wrc), which we will cover later*. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/DSC_0385-scaled-photo-gallery-680x1024.jpg')
```

> Image of the Wind River Crane Flux Tower from [Ameriflux](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-Wrc)


Let's begin by:

1. Installing the `geoNEON` package
2. Making sure that the packages that we need are loaded, and 
3. Supressing 'stirngs as factors' in R, as factors make all sorts of functions in R 'cranky'.

```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors=F)

#install.packages("devtools") #uncomment if you don't yet have devtools
#devtools::install_github("NEONScience/NEON-geolocation/geoNEON")

library(neonUtilities)
library(geoNEON)
library(sp)
```

Now lets begin by pulling in the **vegetation structure data** using the `loadByProduct()` function in the `neonUtilities` package.  Inputs needed to the function are:

* dpID: data product ID; (woody vegetation structure = DP1.10098.001

* site: 4-letter site code; Wind River = WREF

* package: basic or expanded; we'll begin with a `basic` here
```{r, echo=FALSE}
source('/Users/kdw223/Research/katharynduffy.github.io/neon_token_source.R')
```
```{r}
veglist <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.10098.001", site="WREF", package="basic", check.size=FALSE, token = NEON_TOKEN)

```

Now, use the `getLocTOS()` function in the `geoNEON` package to get precise locations for the tagged plants. You can refer to the package documentation for more details.

```{r}
vegmap <- getLocTOS(veglist$vst_mappingandtagging, 
                          "vst_mappingandtagging")
```

Now we need to merge the mapped locations of individuals (the `vst_mappingandtagging table`) with the annual measurements of height, diameter, etc (the `vst_apparentindividual table`). The two tables join based on *individualID*, the identifier for each tagged plant, but we'll include namedLocation, domainID, siteID, and plotID in the list of variables to merge on, to avoid ending up with duplicates of each of those columns. Refer to the variables table and to the Data Product User Guide for Woody plant vegetation structure for more information about the contents of each data table.

```{r}
veg <- merge(veglist$vst_apparentindividual, vegmap, 
             by=c("individualID","namedLocation",
                  "domainID","siteID","plotID"))
```

What did you just pull in?  Are you sure you know what you're working with? A **best practice** is to *always* do a quick visualization to make sure that you have the right data and that you understand its spread:

```{r}
symbols(veg$adjEasting[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")], 
        veg$adjNorthing[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")], 
        circles=veg$stemDiameter[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")]/100/2, 
        inches=F, xlab="Easting", ylab="Northing")
```

A key component of any measurement, and therefore a reoccuring theme in this course, is an **estimate of uncertainty**.  Let's overlay estimates of uncertainty for the location of each stem in blue:

```{r}
symbols(veg$adjEasting[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")], 
        veg$adjNorthing[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")], 
        circles=veg$stemDiameter[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")]/100/2, 
        inches=F, xlab="Easting", ylab="Northing")
symbols(veg$adjEasting[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")], 
        veg$adjNorthing[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")], 
        circles=veg$adjCoordinateUncertainty[which(veg$plotID=="WREF_075")], 
        inches=F, add=T, fg="lightblue")
```


## Intro to NEON Exercises Part 1

### Computational
#### Part 1: Sign up for and Use an NEON API Token:

1. Submit via .Rmd and .pdf a simple script that uses a *HIDDEN* token to access NEON data.

Example:
```{r}
source('neon_token_source.R')
veglist <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.10098.001", site="WREF", package="basic", check.size=FALSE, token = NEON_TOKEN)
summary(veglist)
```

#### Part 2: Further Investigation of NEON TOS Vegetation Structure Data

*In the following section all demonstration code uses the `iris` dataset for R as examples.  In this exercise the `iris` data is merely used for example code to get your started, you will complete all plots and models using the NEON TOS vegetation structure data*

1. Convert the above diameter plot into a ggplot:
If you need some refreshers on ggplot [Derek Sonderegger's Introductory Data Science using R: Graphing Part II](https://dereksonderegger.github.io/444/14-graphing-part-ii.html) is a wonderful resource.  I've pulled some of his plotting examples here.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
print ('your code here')
```

2. Set the color your circles to be a function of each species:

```{r}
#hints:
data("iris")
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, color=Species)) +
  geom_point() 
```

3. Generate a histogram of tree heights for each plot.  Color your stacked bar as a function of each species:

```{r}
#hints for faceting: 
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid( . ~ Species )
```

4. Use `dplyr` to remove dead trees:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
#hints:
#veg=veg%>%
#filter(..... !=....)

```
5. Create a simple linear model that uses DBH and height to predict allometries.  Print the summary information of your model:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#hints
mdl=lm(Some_diameter + Some_height, data=something) #Question: looking at the metadata which 'height' and 'diameter' variables should you use?
print(mdl)
```

6.  Plot your linear model:

```{r}
# hints:
mdl <- lm( Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length * Species, data = iris ) 
iris <- iris %>%
  select( -matches('fit'), -matches('lwr'), -matches('upr') ) %>%
  cbind( predict(mdl, newdata=., interval='confidence') )       

head(iris, n=3)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, color=Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line( aes(y=fit) ) +
  geom_ribbon( aes( ymin=lwr, ymax=upr, fill=Species), alpha=.3 )   # alpha is the ribbon transparency
```

7. Answer the following questions:

* How many `unique` species are present at `WREF`?
* What are the `top_5` trees based on height? Diameter?
* What proportion of sampled trees are dead?



## Part 2: Pulling NEON Data via the API

This section covers pulling data from the NEON API or Application 
Programming Interface using R and the R package httr, but the core 
information about the API is applicable to other languages and approaches.

**As a reminder, there are 3 basic categories of NEON data:**

1. Observational - Data collected by a human in the field, or in an analytical 
laboratory, e.g. beetle identification, foliar isotopes
1. Instrumentation - Data collected by an automated, streaming sensor, e.g. net 
radiation, soil carbon dioxide
1. Remote sensing - Data collected by the airborne observation platform, e.g. 
LIDAR, surface reflectance

This lab covers all three types of data, it is required to complete these sections in order and not skip ahead, since the query principles 
are explained in the first section, on observational data.

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of an API, think of  an API as a 
â€˜middle person' that provides a communication path for a software application 
to obtain information from a digital data source. APIs are becoming a very 
common means of sharing digital information. Many of the apps that you use on 
your computer or mobile device to produce maps, charts, reports, and other 
useful forms of information pull data from multiple sources using APIs. In 
the ecological and environmental sciences, many researchers use APIs to 
programmatically pull data into their analyses. (Quoted from the NEON Observatory
Blog story: 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/observatory/observatory-blog/api-data-availability-viewer-now-live-neon-data-portal" target ="_blank"> API and data availability viewer now live on the NEON data portal</a>.)

There are actually many types or constructions of APIs.  If you're interested you can [read a little more about them here](https://stoplight.io/api-types/)

### Anatomy of an API call

An example API call: http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/data/DP1.10003.001/WOOD/2015-07

This includes the base URL, endpoint, and target.

#### Base URL: 
<span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0</span><span style="color:#A2A4A3">/data/DP1.10003.001/WOOD/2015-07</span>

Specifics are appended to this in order to get the data or metadata you're 
looking for, but all calls to this API will include the base URL. For the NEON 
API, this is http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0 --
not clickable, because the base URL by itself will take you nowhere!

#### Endpoints: 
<span style="color:#A2A4A3">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0</span><span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">/data</span><span style="color:#A2A4A3">/DP1.10003.001/WOOD/2015-07</span>

What type of data or metadata are you looking for?

* **~/products**
  Information about one or all of NEON's data products

* **~/sites**
  Information about data availability at the site specified in the call

* **~/locations**
  Spatial data for the NEON locations specified in the call

* **~/data**
  Data! By product, site, and date (in monthly chunks).

### Targets:
<span style="color:#A2A4A3">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/data</span><span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">/DP1.10003.001/WOOD/2015-07</span>

The specific data product, site, or location you want to get data for.

### Observational data (OS)
Which product do you want to get data for? Consult the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore" target="_blank">Explore Data Products page</a>.

We'll pick Breeding landbird point counts, DP1.10003.001

First query the products endpoint of the API to find out which sites and dates 
have data available. In the products endpoint, the target is the numbered 
identifier for the data product:

```{r os-avail-query}

# Load the necessary libraries
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr, quietly=T)
library(downloader)

# Request data using the GET function & the API call
req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/products/DP1.10003.001")
req
```

The object returned from `GET()` has many layers of information. Entering the 
name of the object gives you some basic information about what you downloaded. 

The `content()` function returns the contents in the form of a highly nested 
list. This is typical of JSON-formatted data returned by APIs. We can use the
`names()` function to view the different types of information within this list.

```{r os-query-contents}

# View requested data
req.content <- content(req, as="parsed")
names(req.content$data)

```

You can see all of the infoamtion by running the line `print(req.content)`, but
this will result in a very long printout in your console. Instead, you can view
list items individually. Here, we highlight a couple of interesting examples:

```{r os-query-contents-examples}

# View Abstract
req.content$data$productAbstract

# View Available months and associated URLs for Onaqui, Utah - ONAQ
req.content$data$siteCodes[[27]]

```

To get a more accessible view of which sites have data for which months, you'll 
need to extract data from the nested list. There are a variety of ways to do this, 
in this tutorial we'll explore a couple of them. Here we'll use `fromJSON()`, in 
the jsonlite package, which doesn't fully flatten the nested list, but gets us 
the part we need. To use it, we need a text version of the content. The text 
version is not as human readable but is readable by the `fromJSON()` function. 

```{r os-query-fromJSON}
# make this JSON readable -> "text"
req.text <- content(req, as="text")

# Flatten data frame to see available data. 
avail <- jsonlite::fromJSON(req.text, simplifyDataFrame=T, flatten=T)
avail

```

The object contains a lot of information about the data product, including: 

* keywords under `$data$keywords`, 
* references for documentation under `$data$specs`, 
* data availability by site and month under `$data$siteCodes`, and 
* specific URLs for the API calls for each site and month under 
`$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls`.

We need `$data$siteCodes` to tell us what we can download.
`$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls` allows us to avoid writing the API 
calls ourselves in the next steps.

```{r os-query-avail-data}

# get data availability list for the product
bird.urls <- unlist(avail$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls)
length(bird.urls) #total number of URLs
bird.urls[1:10] #show first 10 URLs available

```

These are the URLs showing us what files are available for each month where 
there are data. 

Let's look at the bird data from Woodworth (WOOD) site from July 2015. We can do 
this by using the above code but now specifying which site/date we want using 
the `grep()` function. 

Note that if there were only one month of data from a site, you could leave 
off the date in the function. If you want data from more than one site/month 
you need to iterate this code, GET fails if you give it more than one URL. 

```{r os-query-bird-data-urls}
# get data availability for WOOD July 2015
brd <- GET(bird.urls[grep("WOOD/2015-07", bird.urls)])
brd.files <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(brd, as="text"))

# view just the available data files 
brd.files$data$files

```

In this output, `name` and `url` are key fields. It provides us with the names 
of the files available for this site and month, and URLs where we can get the 
files. We'll use the file names to pick which ones we want.

The available files include both **data** and **metadata**, and both the **basic**
and **expanded** data packages. Typically the expanded package includes additional 
quality or uncertainty data, either in additional files or additional fields 
than in the basic files. Basic and expanded data packages are available for 
most NEON data products (some only have basic). Metadata are described by file 
name below.

The format for most of the file names is:

**NEON.[domain number].[site code].[data product ID].[file-specific name].
[date of file creation]**

Some files omit the domain and site, since they're not specific to a 
location, like the data product readme. The date of file creation uses the 
ISO6801 format, in this case 20170720T182547Z, and can be used to determine 
whether data have been updated since the last time you downloaded.

Available files in our query for July 2015 at Woodworth are all of the following
(leaving off the initial NEON.D09.WOOD.10003.001): 

* **~.2015-07.expanded.20170720T182547Z.zip:** zip of all files in the expanded 
package

* **~.brd_countdata.2015-07.expanded.20170720T182547Z.csv:** count data table, 
expanded package version: counts of birds at each point

* **~.brd_perpoint.2015-07.expanded.20170720T182547Z.csv:** point data table, 
expanded package version: metadata at each observation point

* **NEON.Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.brd_personnel.csv:** personnel data 
table, accuracy scores for bird observers

* **~.2015-07.basic.20170720T182547Z.zip:** zip of all files in the basic package

* **~.brd_countdata.2015-07.basic.20170720T182547Z.csv:** count data table, 
basic package version: counts of birds at each point

* **~.brd_perpoint.2015-07.basic.20170720T182547Z.csv:** point data table, 
basic package version: metadata at each observation point

* **NEON.DP1.10003.001_readme.txt:** readme for the data product (not specific 
to dates or location). Appears twice in the list, since it's in both the basic 
and expanded package

* **~.20150101-20160613.xml:** Ecological Metadata Language (EML) file. Appears 
twice in the list, since it's in both the basic and expanded package
  
* **~.validation.20170720T182547Z.csv:** validation file for the data product, 
lists input data and data entry rules. Appears twice in the list, since it's in 
both the basic and expanded package
  
* **~.variables.20170720T182547Z.csv:** variables file for the data product, 
lists data fields in downloaded tables. Appears twice in the list, since it's 
in both the basic and expanded package


We'll get the data tables for the point data and count data in the basic 
package. The list of files doesn't return in the same order every time, so we 
won't use position in the list to select. Plus, we want code we can re-use 
when getting data from other sites and other months. So we select files 
based on the data table name and the package name.


```{r os-get-bird-data}

# Get both files
brd.count <- read.delim(brd.files$data$files$url
                        [intersect(grep("countdata", 
                                        brd.files$data$files$name),
                                    grep("basic", 
                                         brd.files$data$files$name))], 
                        sep=",")

brd.point <- read.delim(brd.files$data$files$url
                        [intersect(grep("perpoint", 
                                        brd.files$data$files$name),
                                    grep("basic", 
                                         brd.files$data$files$name))], 
                        sep=",")

```

Now we have the data and can access it in R. Just to show that the files we 
pulled have actual data in them, let's make a quick graphic:

```{r os-plot-bird-data}
# Cluster by species 
clusterBySp <- brd.count %>%
  dplyr::group_by(scientificName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(total=sum(clusterSize, na.rm=T))

# Reorder so list is ordered most to least abundance
clusterBySp <- clusterBySp[order(clusterBySp$total, decreasing=T),]

# Plot
barplot(clusterBySp$total, names.arg=clusterBySp$scientificName, 
        ylab="Total", cex.names=0.5, las=2)

```

Wow! There are lots of *Agelaius phoeniceus* (Red-winged Blackbirds) at WOOD in July. 


### Instrumentation data (IS)

The process is essentially the same for sensor data. We'll do the same series of 
queries for Soil Temperature, DP1.00041.001. Let's use data from Moab in March 
2017 this time.

```{r soil-data}
# Request soil temperature data availability info
req.soil <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/products/DP1.00041.001")

# make this JSON readable
# Note how we've change this from two commands into one here
avail.soil <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(req.soil, as="text"), simplifyDataFrame=T, flatten=T)

# get data availability list for the product
temp.urls <- unlist(avail.soil$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls)

# get data availability from location/date of interest
tmp <- GET(temp.urls[grep("MOAB/2017-06", temp.urls)])
tmp.files <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(tmp, as="text"))
length(tmp.files$data$files$name) # There are a lot of available files
tmp.files$data$files$name[1:10]   # Let's print the first 10

```

These file names start and end the same way as the observational files, but the 
middle is a little more cryptic. The structure from beginning to end is: 

**NEON.[domain number].[site code].[data product ID].00000.
[soil plot number].[depth].[averaging interval].[data table name].
[year]-[month].[data package].[date of file creation]**

So **"NEON.D13.MOAB.DP1.00041.001.003.507.030.ST_30_minute.2017-06.expanded.20200620T070859Z.csv"** is the: 

* NEON (`NEON.`)
* Domain 13 (`.D13.`)
* Moab field site (`.MOAB.`) 
* soil temperature data (`.DP1.00041.001.`)
* collected in Soil Plot 2, (`.002.`)
* at the 7th depth below the surface (`.507.`)
* and reported as a 30-minute mean of (`.030.` and `.ST_30_minute.`)
* only for the period of June 2017 (`.2017-06.`)
* and provided in a expanded data package (`.basic.`)
* published on June 20th, 2020 (`.0200620T070859Z.`).

More information about interpreting file names can be found in the readme that 
accompanies each download.

Let's get data (and the URL) for only the 2nd depth described above by selecting 
`002.502.030` and the word `basic` in the file name.

Go get it:

``` {r os-get-soil-data}

soil.temp <- read.delim(tmp.files$data$files$url
                        [intersect(grep("002.502.030", 
                                        tmp.files$data$files$name),
                                   grep("basic", 
                                        tmp.files$data$files$name))], 
                        sep=",")

```

Now we have the data and can use it to conduct our analyses. To take 
a quick look at it, let's plot the mean soil temperature by date. 

``` {r os-plot-soil-data}
# plot temp ~ date
plot(soil.temp$soilTempMean~as.POSIXct(soil.temp$startDateTime, 
                                       format="%Y-%m-%d T %H:%M:%S Z"), 
     pch=".", xlab="Date", ylab="T")

```

As we'd expect we see daily fluctuation in soil temperature. 


### Remote sensing data (AOP)

Again, the process of determining which sites and time periods have data, and 
finding the URLs for those data, is the same as for the other data types. We'll 
go looking for High resolution orthorectified camera imagery, DP1.30010, and 
we'll look at the flight over San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) in March 
2017.

```{r aop-data}
# Request camera data availability info
req.aop <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/products/DP1.30010.001")

# make this JSON readable
# Note how we've changed this from two commands into one here
avail.aop <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(req.aop, as="text"), 
                      simplifyDataFrame=T, flatten=T)

# get data availability list for the product
cam.urls <- unlist(avail.aop$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls)

# get data availability from location/date of interest
cam <- GET(cam.urls[intersect(grep("SJER", cam.urls),
                              grep("2017", cam.urls))])
cam.files <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(cam, as="text"))

# this list of files is very long, so we'll just look at the first ten
head(cam.files$data$files$name, 10)

```

File names for AOP data are more variable than for IS or OS data; 
different AOP data products use different naming conventions. 
File formats differ by product as well.

This particular product, camera imagery, is stored in TIFF files. 
For a full list of AOP data products, their naming conventions, and 
their file formats, see **update from NEON?**.

Instead of reading a TIFF into R, we'll download it to the working 
directory. This is one option for getting AOP files from the API; if 
you plan to work with the files in R, you'll need to know how to 
read the relevant file types into R. We hope to add tutorials for 
this in the near future.

To download the TIFF file, we use the `downloader` package, and we'll 
select a file based on the time stamp in the file name: `20170328192931`

``` {r download-aop-data, eval=FALSE}

download(cam.files$data$files$url[grep("20170328192931", 
                                       cam.files$data$files$name)],
         paste(getwd(), "/SJER_image.tif", sep=""), mode="wb")

```


The image, below, of the San Joaquin Experimental Range should now be in your 
working directory.

### Geolocation data

You may have noticed some of the spatial data referenced above are a bit vague, 
e.g. "soil plot 2, 4th depth below the surface."

This section describes how to get spatial data and what to do with it depends on which type of 
data you're working with.

#### Instrumentation data (both aquatic and terrestrial)
Stay tuned - spatial data for instruments are in the process of entry into 
the NEON database.

#### Observational data - Aquatic
Latitude, longitude, elevation, and associated uncertainties are included in 
data downloads. Most products also include an "additional coordinate uncertainty" 
that should be added to the provided uncertainty. Additional spatial data, such 
as northing and easting, can be downloaded from the API.

#### Observational data - Terrestrial
Latitude, longitude, elevation, and associated uncertainties are included in 
data downloads. These are the coordinates and uncertainty of the sampling plot; 
for many protocols it is possible to calculate a more precise location. 
Instructions for doing this are in the respective data product user guides, and 
code is in the `geoNEON` package on GitHub.

### Querying a single named location
Let's look at the named locations in the bird data we downloaded above. To do this, 
look for the field called `namedLocation`, which is present in all observational 
data products, both aquatic and terrestrial.

```{r get-bird-NLs}
# view named location
head(brd.point$namedLocation)

```

Here we see the first six entries in the `namedLocation` column which tells us
the names of the Terrestrial Observation plots where the bird surveys were 
conducted. 

We can query the locations endpoint of the API for the first named location, 
`WOOD_013.birdGrid.brd`. 

```{r brd-ex-NL}
# location data 
req.loc <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/locations/WOOD_013.birdGrid.brd")

# make this JSON readable
brd.WOOD_013 <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(req.loc, as="text"))
brd.WOOD_013

```

Note spatial information under `$data$[nameOfCoordinate]` and under 
`$data$locationProperties`. Also note `$data$locationChildren`: these are the 
finer scale locations that can be used to calculate precise spatial data for 
bird observations.

For convenience, we'll use the `geoNEON` package to make the calculations. 
First we'll use `getLocByName()` to get the additional spatial information 
available through the API, and look at the spatial resolution available in the 
initial download:

```{r brd-extr-NL}

# load the geoNEON package
library(geoNEON)

# extract the spatial data
brd.point.loc <- getLocByName(brd.point)

# plot bird point locations 
# note that decimal degrees is also an option in the data
symbols(brd.point.loc$easting, brd.point.loc$northing, 
        circles=brd.point.loc$coordinateUncertainty, 
        xlab="Easting", ylab="Northing", tck=0.01, inches=F)

```

And use `getLocTOS()` to calculate the point locations of observations.

```{r brd-calc-NL}

brd.point.pt <- getLocTOS(brd.point, "brd_perpoint")


# plot bird point locations 
# note that decimal degrees is also an option in the data
# symbols(brd.point.pt$easting, brd.point.pt$northing, 
#         circles=brd.point.pt$adjCoordinateUncertainty, 
#         xlab="Easting", ylab="Northing", tck=0.01, inches=F)

```

Now you can see the individual points where the respective point counts were 
located. 

### Taxonomy

NEON maintains accepted taxonomies for many of the taxonomic identification 
data we collect. NEON taxonomies are available for query via the API; they 
are also provided via an interactive user interface, the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/static/taxon.html" target="_blank">Taxon Viewer</a>.

NEON taxonomy data provides the reference information for how NEON 
validates taxa; an identification must appear in the taxonomy lists 
in order to be accepted into the NEON database. Additions to the lists 
are reviewed regularly. The taxonomy lists also provide the author 
of the scientific name, and the reference text used.

The taxonomy endpoint of the API works a little bit differently from the 
other endpoints. In the "Anatomy of an API Call" section above, each 
endpoint has a single type of target - a data product number, a named 
location name, etc. For taxonomic data, there are multiple query 
options, and some of them can be used in combination.
For example, a query for taxa in the Pinaceae family:

<span style="color:#A2A4A3">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy</span><span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">/?family=Pinaceae</span>

The available types of queries are listed in the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-api#!/taxonomy/Get_taxonomy" target="_blank">taxonomy section</a> 
of the API web page. Briefly, they are:

* `taxonTypeCode`: Which of the taxonomies maintained by NEON are you 
looking for? BIRD, FISH, PLANT, etc. Cannot be used in combination 
with the taxonomic rank queries.
* each of the major taxonomic ranks from genus through kingdom
* `scientificname`: Genus + specific epithet (+ authority). Search is 
by exact match only, see final example below.
* `verbose`: Do you want the short (`false`) or long (`true`) response
* `offset`: Skip this number of items in the list. Defaults to 50.
* `limit`: Result set will be truncated at this length. Defaults to 50.

Staff on the NEON project have plans to modify the settings for `offset` 
and `limit`, such that `offset` will default to 0 and `limit` will default 
to âˆž, but in the meantime users will want to set these manually. They are 
set to non-default values in the examples below.

For the first example, let's query for the loon family, Gaviidae, in the 
bird taxonomy. Note that query parameters are case-sensitive.

```{r get-loons}
loon.req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy/?family=Gaviidae&offset=0&limit=500")
```

Parse the results into a list using `fromJSON()`:

```{r parse-loons}
loon.list <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(loon.req, as="text"))
```

And look at the `$data` element of the results, which contains:

* The full taxonomy of each taxon
* The short taxon code used by NEON (taxonID/acceptedTaxonID)
* The author of the scientific name (scientificNameAuthorship)
* The vernacular name, if applicable
* The reference text used (nameAccordingToID)

The terms used for each field are matched to Darwin Core (dwc) and 
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif) terms, where 
possible, and the matches are indicated in the column headers.

```{r display-loons}
loon.list$data
```

To get the entire list for a particular taxonomic type, use the 
`taxonTypeCode` query. Be cautious with this query, the PLANT taxonomic 
list has several hundred thousand entries.

For an example, let's look up the small mammal taxonomic list, which 
is one of the shorter ones, and use the `verbose=true` option to see 
a more extensive list of taxon data, including many taxon ranks that 
aren't populated for these taxa. For space here, we display only 
the first 10 taxa:

```{r get-mammals}
mam.req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy/?taxonTypeCode=SMALL_MAMMAL&offset=0&limit=500&verbose=true")
mam.list <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(mam.req, as="text"))
mam.list$data[1:10,]
```

To get information about a single taxon, use the `scientificname` 
query. This query will not do a 'fuzzy match', so you need to query 
the exact name of the taxon in the NEON taxonomy. Because of this, 
the query will be most useful when you already have NEON data in 
hand and are looking for more information about a specific taxon. 
Querying on `scientificname` is unlikely to be an efficient way to 
figure out if NEON recognizes a particular taxon.

In addition, scientific names contain spaces, which are not 
allowed in a URL. The spaces need to be replaced with the URL 
encoding replacement, %20.

For an example, let's look up the little sand verbena, *Abronia 
minor Standl.* Searching for *Abronia minor* will fail, because 
the NEON taxonomy for this species includes the authority. The 
search will also fail with spaces. Search for 
`Abronia%20minor%20Standl.`, and in this case we can omit 
`offset` and `limit` because we know there can only be a single 
result:

```{r get-verbena}
am.req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy/?scientificname=Abronia%20minor%20Standl.")
am.list <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(am.req, as="text"))
am.list$data
```

## Stacking NEON data 

At the top of this tutorial, we installed the `neonUtilities` package. 
This is a custom R package that stacks the monthly files provided by 
the NEON data portal into a single continuous file for each type of 
data table in the download. It currently handles files downloaded from 
the data portal, but not files pulled from the API. That functionality 
will be added soon!

For a guide to using `neonUtilities` on data downloaded from the portal,

### Written

**Question 1:** How does NEON address â€˜dark dataâ€™ (Chapter 1)?

**Question 2:** How might or does the NEON project
intersect with your current research or future career goals? *(1 paragraph)*
</div>



<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Question 3:**
Use the map in **Chapter 2:Intro to NEON** to answer the following questions. Consider the research question that you may explore as your final semester project or a current project that you are working on and answer each of the following questions:

* Are there NEON field sites that are in study regions of interest to you?  
* What domains are the sites located in?  
* What NEON field sites do your current research or Capstone Project ideas
coincide with?  
* Is the site or sites core or relocatable?  
* Are they terrestrial or aquatic?  
* Are there data available for the NEON field site(s) that you are most
interested in? What kind of data are available?
</div>

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Question 4:**
Consider either your current or future research, or a question youâ€™d like to
address durring this course and answer *each* of the following questions:

* Which types of NEON data may be more useful to address these questions?
* What non-NEON data resources could be combined with NEON data to help address your question?
* What challenges, if any, could you foresee when beginning to work with these
data?
</div>

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Question 5:**
Use the Data Portal tools to investigate the data availability for the field
sites youâ€™ve already identified in the previous sections and answer *each* of the following questions:

* What types of aquatic or terrestrial data are currently available? Remote sensing data?  
* Of these, what type of data are you most interested in working with for your project during this course?  
* For what time period does the data cover?  
* What format is the downloadable file available in?  
* Where is the metadata to support this data?  
</div>
