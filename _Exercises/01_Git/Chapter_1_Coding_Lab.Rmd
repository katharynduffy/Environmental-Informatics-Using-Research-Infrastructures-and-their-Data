## Exercises:

1. Navigate to our [course github](https://github.com/katharynduffy/katharynduffy.github.io)
2. `git fork` our repo onto your own personal github account.
3. `git clone` the repo onto your own personal machine in a place that is functional and not temporary *(e.g. not your downloads folder)*.

```{}
#hints
cd `Your/Path/Here'
git clone 'repo HTTPS'
```
4. Add 2-3 sentences introducing yourself in the `_Course-participants` folder.  For example:

```{}
***
Hi, I'm Dr. Katharyn Duffy.  I have a Ph.D in Earth Science from Northern Arizona University.  Over the past two years I've worked as an open-source software engineer in the PhenoCam lab, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course.  I really look forward to working with all of you!

Reminder: add your video
***
```
5. Submit a `pull request` to add your introduction to our course participants folder.

```{}
#hints
git add ...
git commit ...
git status....
git push --set-upstream
git remote -v
git remote add upstream...
```

**Note:** *You may complete these either on the command line or via a program like Atom.io.  If you haven't yet made commits to a remote repository or submitted pull requests please reference the resources listed above.*
